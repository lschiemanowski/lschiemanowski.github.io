My work is concerned with Riemannian geometry of Einstein and special holonomy manifolds using the methods of geometric analysis. A more recent interest of mine are moduli spaces of harmonic maps and Higgs bundles and their hyperkähler geometry.

	<p class="normaltext">In this paper I investigated the potential limits of Riemannian manifolds with Riemann tensor uniformly bounded in L<sup>p</sup>, allowing local collapse. Originally motivated by geometric flows, I developed an independent interest in the question. Using results of Shioya I obtained a particularly pleasant description of the limit spaces of surfaces.</p>

	  The spinor flow behaves rather differently than curvature flows like the Ricci flow. To gain a more concrete understanding Marco Freibert, Hartmut Weiß and I investigated the behavior of the spinor flow on homogeneous manifolds. This setting is substantially more manageable than the general setting, because the parabolic partial differential equation reduces to a ordinary differential equation. An interesting observation we made is that a certain nearly Kähler manifold is a (globally) stable critical point of the homogeneous spinor flow.

	  For any geometric flow a fundamental question is how long the solution persists. For many geometric flows, this can be answered by an invocation of the maximum principle. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case for the spinor flow. An alternative is to use the regularity properties of parabolic equations. This has to be performed carefully because the underlying manifold may degenerate and therefore also the associated differential operators and their properties. The above paper gives a fairly general approach to this question for geometric flows on closed surfaces. For an alternative presentation you may also consult my thesis.

	<p class="normaltext">
	  The spinor flow was introduced by B. Ammann, H. Weiß and F. Witt to find Ricci flat special holonomy metrics using the spinorial characterization of such metrics. This paper verifies a basic expecation for this flow: given a slight perturbation of such a metric, the flow returns to a (potentially different) Ricci flat special holonomy metric at an exponential rate. This property is known as stability and one can also consider the stability of volume constrained critical points of the spinor flow. Sasaki--Einstein, nearly Kähler and nearly G2 metrics are examples of such critical points. In this case, stability is not generally expected and the paper gives a necessary condition. My thesis also contains these results.

      In 2019/2020 I held a class on the Ricci flow on surfaces at the university of Freiburg. The notes contain short time existence, long time existence and convergence of the Ricci flow on closed surfaces. I haven't carefully checked the notes - use at your own risk!
